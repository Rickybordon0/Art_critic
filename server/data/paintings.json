Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance,[4][5] it has been described as \"the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, [and] the most parodied work of art in the world.\"[6] The painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression,[7] monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism.[8]\r\n\r\nThe painting has been traditionally considered to depict the Italian noblewoman Lisa del Giocondo.[9] It is painted in oil on a white poplar panel.[10] Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family.[11] It was believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517.

The theft and subsequent recovery in 1914 generated unprecedented publicity for an art theft, and led to the publication of many cultural depictions such as the 1915 opera Mona Lisa, two early 1930s films (The Theft of the Mona Lisa and Arsène Lupin), and the song \"Mona Lisa\" recorded by Nat King Cole—one of the most successful songs of the 1950s.[13]\r\n\r\nThe Mona Lisa is one of the most valuable paintings in the world.
